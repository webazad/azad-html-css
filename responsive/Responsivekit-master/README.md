## A Beautiful Boilerplate for Responsive, Mobile-First Development

As stated by Dave to me in a email:

> "This looks awesome man. Pure awesome. I love that you flipped the queries to actually optimize for a true mobile first implementation and extending it to 1200px is a great idea. I honestly think you should fork Skeleton on Github and create this as your own repo and I would be happy to link it up on the docs."

So I forked the original [skeleton](http://www.getskeleton.com) and here it is Responsivekit.

Responsivekit was born with a more deeply support for mobile world in mind, trying to keep at minumin javascript and css size. With a conscious use of css media queries, I implementd a mobile first approach in wich a mobile browser is not constrained to apply a desktop browser style to then overwrite with a mobile one.

I added also responsive tables to make the boilerplate as complete as possible.
